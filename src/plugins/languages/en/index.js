      description: `Our platform connects electric car owners with parking owners or land owners who have
          charging stations available for rent. Charger distributors can also list their chargers on
          our platform. Electric car owners can easily find and book charging stations, while
          parking and land owners can earn money by renting out their chargers when they're not in
          use. It's a win-win for everyone!`
